# Eunoia

Eunoia is a psychology-inspired AI assistant designed to guide users through thoughtful self-reflection and emotional understanding. It provides a calm, nonjudgmental space to talk about personal concerns, helping users gain insight through conversation.

## üå± Project Vision

Eunoia (from the Greek word meaning "beautiful thinking") is designed as a minimal, calming environment where users feel safe sharing thoughts or emotions. With roots in therapy-inspired dialogue, it mimics a structured self-exploration process guided by a supportive AI persona called **Noema**.

The app guides users through:

1. Sharing a concern
2. Clarifying questions
3. Identifying underlying patterns
4. Reflecting on emotional insights
5. Summarizing findings (if desired)

It does not replace therapy, but offers a warm digital space for introspection.

## üí° Future Ideas

- User account system with saved chat summaries
- Embedding past summaries in a vector DB for improved personalization
- Enhanced tooling (e.g. web search, emotion classification)
- Dark/light theme toggle

## üîí Notes on Privacy and Cost

- Each session is private and resets on page reload
- Memory management uses GPT-3.5 for summaries to keep token costs low
- Hosted versions should monitor API usage to prevent cost overruns
