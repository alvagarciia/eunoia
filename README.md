## üå± Project Vision

Eunoia (from the Greek word meaning "beautiful thinking") is designed as a minimal, calming environment where users feel safe sharing thoughts or emotions. With roots in therapy-inspired dialogue, it mimics a structured self-exploration process guided by a supportive AI persona called **Noema**.

The app guides users through:

1. Sharing a concern
2. Clarifying questions
3. Identifying underlying patterns
4. Reflecting on emotional insights
5. Summarizing findings (if desired)

It does not replace therapy, but offers a warm digital space for introspection.
